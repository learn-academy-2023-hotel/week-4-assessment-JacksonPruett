# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: The virtual DOM (document object model) is lightweight sort of version of the DOM that allows for easier updates.

Researched answer: The virtual DOM is a fundamental idea utilized in React, which is a widely-used JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It serves as a lightweight, internal model of the real web page's structure. This virtual representation is crucial for enhancing React's speed and overall performance.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Unlike Javascript, a return is implied in Ruby based on the code given. If a function is written out for instance and a loop is created, Ruby knows an output will be desired because there was an input. In JS if no return or output is explicitly requested then the terminal throws up an error.   

Researched answer: In Ruby, you don't always have to use the "return" keyword because it has implicit returns. In simple terms, if the last thing in a sequence of instructions is a value or expression, Ruby assumes that it's what you want to return, making "return" optional in such cases.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: Well for starts both languages are object oriented programming languages and both are interpreted, mearning they don't need to be compiled into machine. They also have a lot of built-in methods and functions to make things easier for the developer. However, they differ in many ways as well. JS can be used as a front-end and back-end language, where as Ruby is reserved for back-end programming. Ruby is significantly more forgiving when it comes to syntax and it's implicit return.

Researched answer: Ruby and JavaScript share similarities:

Both are object-oriented, interpreted languages.
They have active communities and abundant third-party libraries.
They are among the most popular languages.
Both can handle back-end development depending on the framework.
However, they differ:

JavaScript works for both front-end and back-end, while Ruby is mostly for back-end.
Ruby tracks memory usage, which JavaScript doesn't.
Ruby has a simpler syntax, while JavaScript can be more verbose.
Ruby suits CPU-intensive programs better.
JavaScript excels in raw performance due to its highly optimized engine.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A version manager allows a programmer to switch between software versions based on need. Suppose they're working on a piece of software that was written in an older build of Ruby but their computer currently runs the latest version, they're gonna need to downgrade their current version to work on that software. A version manager makes downgrading builds much simpler, and in some cases makes them possible at all.

Researched answer: Version managers are tools that enable you to have multiple Ruby versions installed on your computer and easily switch between them as needed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: RSpec serves as a valuable testing tool for Ruby, particularly in the context of behavior-driven development (BDD). It holds a prominent place as the go-to testing library for Ruby in actual production applications. While its rich and powerful domain-specific language (DSL) is impressive, at its core, RSpec is a user-friendly tool that you can quickly dive into.

2. Test-driven development: Test-driven development, often referred to as TDD, represents a distinctive approach to software development. It hinges on a fundamental principle - that software requirements should be transformed into test cases before the software is fully developed.

3. CRUD: So, CRUD, it's like the ABCs of software. You've got these four basic things software should do â€“ Create, Read, Update, and Delete. In apps, people need to make new stuff (Create), see the stuff on the screen (Read), change the stuff (Update), and sometimes get rid of the stuff (Delete).
